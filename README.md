# TUSMail-App
An Android app to access the student TUS Webmail, without having to use the inconvenient web site.

## Done so far
- Login (completely)
- Main UI for the mailbox activity and the base for all the mailing done using HTTP that cannot be done through POP3

## To be done
- Having functional mailboxes
- Sending mail

## Extra tasks
- Checking for mail in the background and sending notifications when a new one arrives

## Notes
- This was created in Android Studio and it may contain some leftover files, specific to the IDE.
- The app may or may not ever be finished. This is a side project and requires some time, which I don't have much of due to my academic studies and my job.
